# Introduction

Forked from Jianing's Emacs Configuration

Trying to switch from Vim to Emacs since I'm using iPad Pro as a productivity tool at the moment.

A problem is that the bluetooth keyboard doesn't have ESC key, which is the same problem that A new Macbook Pro has.

Emacs could help to avoid using ESC, so I decide to start using Emacs again.


Thanks for Jianing's configuration, it gives me a lot of ideas to start.


TODO:

* [X] changed hard-code home dir
* [ ] need to fix the Alt key on iPad mode.
* [ ] make a slim version of this configuration.
